Flying a glider over Boulder, Colorado (2015)
Upon immigrating to the US, flying had suddenly become feasible for me.  I met an experienced pilot at my local airfield and studied with him, eventually passing my check-ride at age 17.  Since then, I fly when I can find the opportunity.  In the meantime, I continue to read on flight theories, navigation, radios, meteorology and aviation literature.

The celestial equator over Deal Test Site, NJ, facing east (2017)
The study of navigation is a good way to continue engaging in flying and sailing while not piloting a vessel.  The great amount of material to master makes it an exciting challenge in its own right.  It can be practiced nearly anywhere with pen and paper, a watch, logarithmic tables and a sextant.  The oceanic expanses of time and space involved fill me with awe.

At anchor in Anse a Colombier, FWI (2014)
After moving to New York City, flying became impractical.  The city was better suited to sailing, so I found and took up an old Pearson sloop.  The boat was older than me with an inoperable engine, but a solid hull and good sails.  I spent many hours on repairs and in return, it gave me hours of headache, heartbreak and joy.  As with flying, the fascination of sailing filled days with hours of reading, preparation, projects and dreaming.

Univ. of Colorado Water Polo team, celebrating the regional championship in Tucson, AZ (2001)
As many do, I learned much about teamwork through sport.  In university, I was part of our water polo team.  My team mates and I are still close personally, if not geographically.  Watching them start families and navigate careers gives me as much joy as did playing with them.  Every so often, I still visit them and get into the water or go to get dinner.

Seared skipjack, prepared for my family and friends (2015)
Soon after moving from Tokyo to the US, I began to work in a Japanese restaurant.  Beginning with simple preparation work in the kitchen, I gradually learned more and took on greater responsibilities, eventually working as a full member of the cooking staff.  Our guests were a pleasure, regulars and our colleagues were close friends and I was able to work through university debt free.  Pictured here is skipjack, for which the IUCN conservation status is currently Least Concern.

My wife and daughters are my most important responsibility.  When they can be involved with other aspects of my life, I take joy in including them or teaching them about what I'm doing.  My wife and I look forward to seeing our daughters grow and develop their own lives and personalities.
