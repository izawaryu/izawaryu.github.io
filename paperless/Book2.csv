oh
i
have
slipped
the surly
bonds
of earth
and danced
the skies
on
laughter
silvered
wings.
sunward I've climbed
and joined the tumbling mirth
of sun-split clouds
and done a hundred
things
you have not dreamed of
"up, up along the delerious burning blue"
where never lark or even eagle flew
hov'ring there
